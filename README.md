# GPA-Calculator-Streamlit
The application provides a user-friendly interface to calculate both semester and accumulative GPAs. Users can input details such as the number of courses, credits, and grades for each course. The GPA is then automatically computed, considering the credit hours of each course and the corresponding letter grades.
